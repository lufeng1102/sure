# /sure_feed

Feed ModelScope, HuggingFace, or GitHub speech models into the SURE pipeline: discover candidates, match to a SURE task family, collect metadata, optionally convert fetched resources to the SURE resource layout (oref), synthesize canonical `MODEL_INPUT`, rank/select, and emit a handoff manifest that `/sure_onboard` consumes. This skill is the Sure port of the XForge→SURE bridge. The state machine lives in `hooks/state-machine.ts`; this document is what the agent reads to drive each unit.

**Prerequisite**: run `/sure_init` first to select an agent, configure auth, and validate the environment for this project. The pre-start hook resolves the versioned common Harness Runtime and exports `HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN`; run deterministic backend scripts with `"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN"`, never a model Python or bare `python3`.

The pre-start hook also writes `artifacts/runtime_binding.json` (`sure.skill.runtime_binding.v1`). It binds the materialized Harness Runtime by ID, lock hash, executable, and manifest. The same document explicitly marks Model Runtime and Evaluation Runtime as not required because Feed performs neither inference nor evaluation. The terminal gate revalidates this declaration and its materialized manifest.

Control principle: **agent decides scope, scripts enforce format and execution.** You (the agent) choose the source, query, filters, and watch mode; the deterministic scripts under `scripts/` and the hook gates enforce that every artifact is in the right place, the right format, and the right value domain — and that the strong-plus-weak matching contract holds.

This skill is **self-contained**: all backend code is bundled under `scripts/` (the `sure_feed/` inner package + flat `xforge_*.py` scripts + gate validators). There are no references to the external `/hpc/.../sure` repo or to `XForge/skills`.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Meaning |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `source` | — | `modelscope \| huggingface \| github \| multi`. Default `multi` for online discovery. |
| `hf_endpoint` | — | `auto \| huggingface \| hf-mirror \| <url>`. Default `auto`; fallback to `hf-mirror` only for network/5xx failures. |
| `url` / positional URL | — | Direct HuggingFace, ModelScope, or GitHub model URL. Preferred over search. |
| `watch_mode` | — | `once \| watch`. Default `once`. |
| `query` / `filter` | — | Task / license / time-window filters for discovery. |
| `max_models` | — | Cap on candidates scanned this run. |
| `download` | — | When true, materialize/fetch weights where supported. Default false for feed discovery. |
| `handoff` | — | When true (default), publish `sure/handoffs/<model_name>/model_input.yaml` plus an `artifacts/` evidence folder for `/sure_onboard`. |
| `handoff_root` | — | Override the handoff publication root. Default: repo-level `sure/handoffs`. |
| `output_dir` | — | Absolute directory where the harness collects this invocation's `result.json` and control artifacts. The harness consumes it before the agent starts, so the handoff still belongs under `sure/handoffs/<model_name>/` where `/sure_onboard` looks for it; use `handoff_root` to publish somewhere else. The directory must be outside every configured `forbidden_output_roots` entry and writable. |
| `since` | — | Incremental-scan timestamp (watch mode). |
| `max_retries` | — | Consecutive blocked gate attempts allowed per unit before the run terminates. Default `3`. |

The run directory (`<run_dir>`, provided by the Sure invocation) retains normal run products under `artifacts/` for auditability. The onboarding handoff is additionally published as a single model folder:

```text
sure/handoffs/<model_name>/
├── model_input.yaml
└── artifacts/
    ├── feed_report.json
    ├── scan_result.json
    ├── match_task_result.json
    ├── metadata_result.json
    ├── oref_result.json
    ├── model_input_result.json
    ├── rank_select_result.json
    ├── handoff_manifest.json
    └── source_run.json
```

`model_input.yaml` is the only canonical onboarding input. `artifacts/` is retained research/evidence metadata. Handoff folders are not deleted automatically after onboard; they are a stable user-facing cache and audit surface.

## State Machine

Advance happens **only** when the current unit's `produces` artifact is compliant (location + format + value domain; no forbidden fields). Linear units are agent self-driven; gate units additionally run a Python semantic check. Produce the current unit's artifact, then call `sure_update_state`.

| # | Unit | Kind | Produces | Gate script |
|---|------|------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | `scan_modelscope` | linear | `scan_result.json` | — |
| 2 | `match_task` | **gate** | `match_task_result.json` | `scripts/check_match_task.py` |
| 3 | `collect_metadata` | linear | `metadata_result.json` | — |
| 4 | `convert_to_oref` | linear | `oref_result.json` | — |
| 5 | `synthesize_model_input` | **gate** | `model_input_result.json` | `scripts/check_model_input.py` |
| 6 | `rank_and_select` | **gate** | `rank_select_result.json` | `scripts/check_rank_select.py` |
| 7 | `extract_lessons` | **gate** | `extraction_declaration.json` | `scripts/check_memory_extraction.py` |
| 8 | `emit_handoff_manifest` | linear | `handoff_manifest.json` | — |

Total: 8 units. Retries cap at 3 per unit; on exhaustion the run is marked FAILED with a `failure_taxonomy` reason — no blind retry.

`extract_lessons` is the exception: after two consecutive gate failures the hook advances by itself and records `extraction: failed`; it never ends FAILED.

If the same hook/gate blocks three consecutive attempts, stop agent-side repair and ask the user to confirm the model link, access permissions, and whether the model card/README contains enough install, load, inference, fixture, and output-contract information. Do not keep fabricating fields to escape the hook.

## Red Lines

- **Strong-plus-weak matching is mandatory.** Every matched candidate must carry `match.match_source` such as `tasks`, `pipeline_tag`, `model_card`, `readme`, `repo_topics`, or `custom_tag`. The MATCH_TASK gate rejects candidates that claim `matched:true` without provenance. Short ambiguous abbreviations (e.g. `gr` in a name) are NOT task evidence by themselves — see `references/agents.md` for the `microsoft/Dayhoff-3b-GR-HM` false-positive case.
- **Research narrows broad provider tags.** Provider taxonomies such as HuggingFace `audio-text-to-text` are broad evidence, not final SURE tasks. Before finalizing `task_type`, read model id, tags, README/model card, examples, and output contract. Apply narrowing precedence `sa_asr > sd > asr > speech_understanding`: `transcribe/transcription/asr` plus `diarization/speaker attribution` means `sa_asr`, not generic `speech_understanding`.
- **No synthetic candidates.** When discovery fails, emit `candidates: []` and stop. Do not invent models.
- **MODEL_INPUT is the onboarding contract.** Before `/sure_onboard`, every selected model must have a complete `MODEL_INPUT` object matching `schemas/model_input.schema.json`: repo, weights, environment hint, phase-1 target, entrypoints, fixture, and IO contract.
- **Policy defaults must be explicit evidence.** If upstream documentation does not declare `environment_hint.python_version`, use the SURE policy default only with evidence `{source: local, field: sure_policy.python_version_default, model_input_field: environment_hint.python_version}`. Do not mark this field unresolved solely because the model card omitted a Python version.
- **Runtime strategy can bridge non-standard repos.** Some models document ONNX/CLI/runtime surfaces rather than a clean Python `import/load/infer` split. In that case, emit `runtime_strategy` and `policy_resolved:` entrypoints backed by provider tags/model-card evidence. `policy_resolved:` entrypoints without `runtime_strategy` are invalid.
- **Agent research first.** Scripts may extract candidate fields from provider APIs and model cards, but the agent must continue researching README/examples/source files when fields are unresolved. Hooks verify evidence and block hacks; they are not a substitute for research.
- **Fixture registry first.** After task matching, open the matching `fixtures/tasks/<task>/README.md` and select concrete files from that task registry. Model-card demo audio/text may be recorded as `provider_fixture_hint`, but it must not replace the task fixture unless a model-specific fixture is explicitly created and recorded.
- **GitHub is not a default weights source.** GitHub can be the repo/evidence source. `weights.source` must be one of `huggingface`, `modelscope`, `local`, `api`, `pip`, or `release_or_pypi`.
- **Handoff must be actionable.** `sure/handoffs/<model_name>/model_input.yaml` is the single onboarding input. The debug `handoff_manifest.json` must still carry `repo`, `weights_source`, and `model_input` or `model_input_path` for every selected model so the terminal state-machine unit remains auditable. The RANK_AND_SELECT gate rejects selections missing `repo` or with a negative `score`.

## Per-Unit Contracts

Each unit below lists: **Inputs** (what to read), **Output** (produces + schema), **Allowed** (value domain), **Must Not Do** (forbidden fields — anti-step-merge), **Failure** (taxonomy + which script). One unit at a time. After producing the current unit's artifact, call `sure_update_state`.

### 1. scan_modelscope (linear)
- **Inputs**: a direct model URL or the `source`, `query`/`filter`, `max_models`, `since` parameters. Direct URL mode is preferred: run `scripts/sure_feed_online_discover.py <url>` and skip search/ranking ambiguity. For online no-download search across ModelScope/HuggingFace/GitHub, run `scripts/sure_feed_online_discover.py <query>`. For legacy ModelScope-only reports, run `scripts/xforge_collect_model.py` or `xforge_daily_modelscope_summary.py`. For HuggingFace, use `--hf-endpoint auto` by default; if direct `huggingface.co` is unreachable, the provider falls back to `https://hf-mirror.com` and records `endpoint_used`/`fallback_reason`.
- **Output**: `scan_result.json` (`schemas/scan_result.schema.json`). Top-level `candidates[]`, each `{model_id, source, repo, source_url, tasks[], custom_tag, pipeline_tag, tags[], description, license, download_count}` when available.
- **Allowed**: `source ∈ {modelscope, huggingface, github, multi}`.
- **Must Not Do**: do NOT include `selected` or `handoff_manifest_path` here — those belong to later units (anti-merge). Do NOT invent candidates; an empty `candidates: []` is valid. Do NOT add memory fields to `scan_result.json` (its schema forbids extra keys).
- **Memory**: also read `artifacts/memory_context.json` when it exists: the `pre_start` hook writes it with the memory facts that match this run's target and arguments, shape `{schema: "sure.memory.context.v1", skill, target_id, facts: [{entry_id, title, path, scope, checked_at, stale, status}], omitted_provisional}`; the file is written even when nothing matched (`facts: []`); it is advisory, verify before relying, and `stale: true` means the fact is older than its scope's re-check limit. Routing for the rest of the memory tree is `references/memory/ROUTING.md`.
- **Failure**: `discovery_failed` (network/proxy/502 → rerun without proxies first), `no_candidates_in_window`.

### 2. match_task (gate)
- **Inputs**: `scan_result.json`. For each candidate, classify against the target SURE task using provider fields (`tasks`, HuggingFace `pipeline_tag`, repo topics) as starting evidence, then do research narrowing with model id, tags, README/model card, examples, and output-contract hints.
- **Output**: `match_task_result.json` (`schemas/match_task_result.schema.json`). Each candidate carries a `match` object: `{matched, match_source, task_type, score, evidence[]}`.
- **Allowed**: `matched ∈ {true, false}`. `match_source` must name the evidence channel.
- **Must Not Do**: do NOT claim `matched:true` without recording `match_source`. Do NOT let a short ambiguous abbreviation (e.g. `gr`) count as task evidence unless metadata also carries speech/gender semantics. Do NOT finalize broad `audio-text-to-text` as `speech_understanding` when model evidence says transcription plus diarization/speaker attribution; narrow it to `sa_asr`.
- **Gate**: `scripts/check_match_task.py` — verifies every matched candidate has a non-empty `match_source`. Exit 0 = pass.
- **Failure**: `missing_match_provenance`, `weak_abbreviation_false_positive`.

### 3. collect_metadata (linear)
- **Inputs**: matched candidates from `match_task_result.json`. Collect model card, README, release, package, dependency, and example-inference evidence. Run `scripts/xforge_modelscope_fetch.py` only when `download=true`; default feed mode should not fetch large weights.
- **Output**: `metadata_result.json` (`schemas/metadata_result.schema.json`). `models[]` each `{model_id, source, repo, source_url, weights_source, license, frameworks[], entrypoint_hints, environment_hints, metadata_summary}`.
- **Allowed**: `weights_source` may be `null` only while evidence is still insufficient; it must be resolved before `synthesize_model_input`.
- **Must Not Do**: do NOT include `handoff_manifest_path` here (anti-merge). Do NOT mark a remote model ready unless a deterministic local path is recorded.
- **Failure**: `fetch_failed`, `weights_unresolved`.

### 4. convert_to_oref (linear)
- **Inputs**: `metadata_result.json`. If artifacts were fetched, run `scripts/xforge_process_to_oref.py` (or `xforge_modelscope_dataset_to_oref.py` for datasets) to convert them to the SURE resource (oref) layout. If this is no-download discovery, emit a valid `oref_result.json` with `converted[]` entries that preserve `model_id` and null/unmaterialized weights paths as appropriate.
- **Output**: `oref_result.json` (`schemas/oref_result.schema.json`). `converted[]` each `{model_id, oref_path, weights_path}`.
- **Must Not Do**: do NOT include `handoff_manifest_path` here (anti-merge).
- **Failure**: `conversion_failed`, `oref_path_missing`.

### 5. synthesize_model_input (gate)
- **Inputs**: `metadata_result.json`, `oref_result.json`, and task evidence from `match_task_result.json`. Build one canonical `MODEL_INPUT` per matched candidate.
- **Output**: `model_input_result.json` (`schemas/model_input_result.schema.json`). `model_inputs[]` each `{model_id, source, model_input_path, model_input, evidence[], confidence, missing_or_weak_fields}`.
- **Allowed**: `model_input.task_type ∈ {asr,s2tt,sd,ser,tts,vc,kws,slu,gr,speech_understanding,sa-asr,sa_asr}`; `deployment_type ∈ {local,api}`; `weights.source ∈ {huggingface,modelscope,local,api,pip,release_or_pypi}`.
- **Environment and runtime strategy**: `environment_hint.python_version` may come from upstream documentation or from the SURE policy default; record the source in evidence and, when available, `python_version_source`. If README/API evidence shows a runtime surface such as `sherpa-onnx`, `onnxruntime`, CLI serving, or another non-standard adapter path, emit `runtime_strategy {type, framework, load_surface, inference_surface}` and use `policy_resolved:` entrypoints instead of fabricating Python import/load snippets.
- **Fixture selection**: use `scripts/sure_feed/fixture_registry.py` or equivalent agent research to read `fixtures/tasks/<task>/README.md`, select the task-specific smoke fixture, and emit `model_input.fixture.fixture_source: task_registry` with `fixture_index`, `fixture_root`, and concrete sample paths. For `speech_understanding`, read `fixtures/tasks/speech_understanding/README.md`, infer atomic subtasks from model evidence, then select only those atomic fixture indexes.
- **Must Not Do**: do NOT pass a partial onboarding input. Do NOT set `weights.source: github`; use `release_or_pypi` for GitHub release assets or a concrete HuggingFace/ModelScope/local/API/pip source. Do NOT use environment setup commands (`python -m venv`, `pip install`, `conda create`, `uv venv`, system package installation) as inference entrypoints. Do NOT use `tests/fixtures/shared/...` or provider demo audio as the primary fixture when `fixtures/tasks/<task>/` has a representative sample.
- **Gate**: `scripts/check_model_input.py` — verifies every emitted `model_input` has repo, weights, environment hint, entrypoints, fixture, IO contract, evidence, and valid enums. Exit 0 = pass.
- **Failure**: `model_input_incomplete`, `weights_source_invalid`, `missing_evidence`.

### 6. rank_and_select (gate)
- **Inputs**: `model_input_result.json` plus earlier task/metadata evidence. Score candidates (task match strength, evidence quality, downloads/stars, recency, license, runtime clarity) and select.
- **Output**: `rank_select_result.json` (`schemas/rank_select_result.schema.json`). `selected[]` each `{model_id, repo, weights_source, task_type, score, rank_reason, model_input_path, model_input}`.
- **Allowed**: `score` must be `≥ 0`.
- **Must Not Do**: do NOT select a candidate without `repo` — `/sure_onboard` cannot handoff without a repo. Do NOT use a negative `score`.
- **Gate**: `scripts/check_rank_select.py` — verifies the selection is non-empty and every selected candidate has `repo` + non-negative `score`. Exit 0 = pass.
- **Failure**: `selection_empty`, `missing_repo_for_handoff`, `negative_score`.

### 7. extract_lessons (gate)
- **Inputs**: `artifacts/run_digest.json`, written by the hook the moment `rank_and_select` passed (read it; never rebuild it in place).
- **Output**: `artifacts/extraction_declaration.json` — the run artifacts root, not `artifacts/debug/` — `{schema, no_new_lessons, no_lessons_reason, covered_by, candidates, infra_noise, infra_evidence}` plus 0 to 5 candidate directories under `artifacts/candidates/<nn>-<slug>/` (`proposal.json` + `proposal.md`) and, for facts, evidence files under `artifacts/memory_evidence/`. The full contract (digest fields, candidate formats, the gate's ten checks, the write-tools-only rule) is `sure/runtime/memory/EXTRACTION.md`; read it before writing anything.
- **Allowed**: write candidates and evidence first and the declaration last. `no_new_lessons: true` with a one-line reason is the normal result of a clean run.
- **Must Not Do**: do NOT run `scripts/build_run_digest.py` onto `artifacts/run_digest.json` (a preview goes to `--out <run_dir>/artifacts/run_digest.preview.json` and the gate ignores it). Do NOT write under `sure/memory/` or `references/memory/`. Do NOT use bash heredocs for these files.
- **Gate**: `scripts/check_memory_extraction.py` — checks the declaration and every candidate directory (shape, evidence paths, triggers, duplicates, digest sha). Changing a candidate re-runs the gate even when `extraction_declaration.json` did not change.
- **Failure**: `extraction_declaration_invalid`. After two consecutive gate failures the hook advances on its own with `extraction: failed`; switching to `no_new_lessons: true` with the reason is always a valid way out.

### 8. emit_handoff_manifest (linear, terminal)
- **Inputs**: `rank_select_result.json`. Assemble the handoff manifest consumed by `/sure_onboard`.
- **Output**: `artifacts/debug/handoff_manifest.json` (`schemas/handoff_manifest.schema.json`). `{manifest_path, source, models[{model_id, repo, weights_source, task_type, score, model_input_path, model_input}], next_action}`. The user-facing onboarding input is published at `sure/handoffs/<model_name>/model_input.yaml`; the user-facing summary is copied into `sure/handoffs/<model_name>/artifacts/feed_report.json`.
- **Must Not Do**: do NOT omit `manifest_path` or `models`. Every `models[]` entry must carry `repo` and enough `MODEL_INPUT` data for `/sure_onboard`.
- **Failure**: `manifest_incomplete`.

## Backend Routing

- `scripts/sure_feed_online_discover.py` is the preferred no-download online discovery entrypoint. It writes run-local audit products under `<run_dir>/artifacts/` and publishes the clean onboarding product under `sure/handoffs/<model_name>/model_input.yaml`. The skeleton artifacts (`scan_result.json`, `match_task_result.json`, `metadata_result.json`, `oref_result.json`, `model_input_result.json`, `rank_select_result.json`, `handoff_manifest.json`) are debug-only in the run and copied into the handoff `artifacts/` folder.
- Flat scripts (`xforge_*.py`) do the network/disk work; the `sure_feed/` inner package provides catalog/bridge/watcher logic imported by the flat scripts.
- Only `xforge_modelscope_dataset_to_oref.py` imports `modelscope` at module top level; the `sure_feed/` package itself imports cleanly without it, so gate scripts run under the locked common `HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN`.
- Network ModelScope calls need proxy variables removed (`env -u HTTP_PROXY -u HTTPS_PROXY -u http_proxy -u https_proxy -u ALL_PROXY -u all_proxy`). A transient `502 Bad Gateway` is not "no candidates" — rerun first.
- HuggingFace metadata calls use the canonical `https://huggingface.co` repo URL in `MODEL_INPUT` even when the actual API request used `https://hf-mirror.com`; mirror usage is evidence, not the canonical model identity.
- Per-skill dependency declaration lives in `scripts/pyproject.toml` (pyyaml, modelscope).

## Memory (advisory)

Earlier runs leave agent-written notes. `sure/memory/index.md` (repo root) is the merged index: confirmed and provisional entries, one bullet each with its triggers. Confirmed files live under `references/memory/bad_cases/` and `sure/skills/_shared/memory/facts/`. Nothing in them is human-reviewed: verify against evidence before relying on one, and never copy a command from an entry into an artifact without running it.

- At `pre_start` the hook writes `artifacts/memory_context.json` with the facts that match this run (shape quoted in the `scan_modelscope` contract above; written even when empty); `scan_modelscope` reads it.
- When a gate blocks, the repair text may end with a block whose first line is `Memory (advisory, agent-written, not human-reviewed; verify against evidence before relying):`, listing at most two entries from earlier runs. Read the entry file named there when it looks relevant, then fix the artifact.
- `references/memory/ROUTING.md` says when to open the index and the bad-case files by hand.
- `extract_lessons` (unit 7) writes what this run learned; the contract is `sure/runtime/memory/EXTRACTION.md`. Publishing to `sure/memory/provisional/` happens in `post_finish` without you; moving entries into `references/` is a human step.

## Cross-Skill Handoff

`sure/handoffs/<model_name>/model_input.yaml` → `/sure_onboard model=<model_name>` or `/sure_onboard model_input_path=sure/handoffs/<model_name>/model_input.yaml` → model staged under `sure/models/<model_name>/` with `artifacts/deployment_ready.json` → an operator reviews and copies the complete model directory into a configured `approved_models_roots` entry → `/sure_infer model=<model_name>` resolves only that approved copy. `sure/handoffs/<model_name>/artifacts/feed_report.json` is the user-facing run summary; `artifacts/debug/handoff_manifest.json` is retained as the terminal state-machine artifact.

See `references/agents.md` for the full matching contract, false-positive case, and backend routing table.

## 引擎驱动协议（Claude Code 适配层）

本技能由 agent 无关的 `sure-engine` MCP 服务器驱动（结构化工具调用，而非手写 bash）。启动、门控、结束都通过 MCP 工具完成；未装 MCP 时用文末的 bash 兜底。

### 命令序列（MCP 工具）

1. 启动运行（执行 pre_start 门控）：调用 `sure_run_start`，入参
   `{ "skill": "sure_feed", "args": "url=https://huggingface.co/OpenMOSS-Team/MOSS-Transcribe-Diarize" }`。
   成功返回 `{ ok:true, runId, prompt, record, state }`，**记下 runId**；失败返回 `{ ok:false, repair }`，按 repair 修正后重试。

2. 每次 Bash 操作**前**：调用 `sure_run_gate`，入参
   `{ "runId": "<runId>", "point": "pre_tool_call", "tool": "bash", "command": "<实际命令>" }`。
   返回 `allowed:false` 时**不得执行**该命令，按 `repair` 修正后重新门控。

3. 执行 shell 命令。

4. 每次 Bash 操作**后**：调用 `sure_run_gate`，入参
   `{ "runId": "<runId>", "point": "post_tool_result", "tool": "bash", "isError": <true|false> }`。
   这是状态机推进点；`allowed:false` 表示当前单元产物未通过门控，按 `repair` 修产物后再次 post 门控，不跳单元。

5. 重复 2–4，直到状态机到达终态单元。

6. 结束运行：先写最终 manifest（见下），再调用 `sure_run_finish`，入参
   `{ "runId": "<runId>", "status": "success", "manifestPath": ".sure/runs/<runId>/manifest.json", "summary": "<摘要>" }`。
   manifest 校验或 pre_finish 门控失败返回 `{ ok:false, repair }`，按 repair 修 manifest/产物后再 finish。

其它工具：`sure_run_state`（查状态，`{runId}`）、`sure_run_resume`（续接，`{runId}` 可省）、`sure_run_on_error`（出错收尾，`{runId, reason}`）。

### 门控纪律（必须）

- run 启动后，**每次** Bash 操作都必须先 `sure_run_gate`（pre_tool_call）、后 `sure_run_gate`（post_tool_result），不许跳过。
- pre 门控 `allowed:false`：不执行该命令，先修。
- post 门控 `allowed:false`：当前单元未通过，先修产物，不跳单元、不盲跑。
- 状态机只在 post 门控通过时推进；不要手动改 `.sure/runs/<runId>/state.json` 或 checkpoint。
- 若安装了 `install.sh --with-hooks` 硬拦截，中间门控由 Claude hooks 自动执行，agent 只需 start/finish。

### 无 MCP 时 bash 兜底

`node <repo>/sure-engine/dist/cli.js run start|gate|finish|state|resume|on-error ...`，与上述 MCP 工具一一对应（参数与工具入参一致，`--cwd <repo>` 指向含 `sure/skills/` 的目录）。

### 最终 manifest

最终 manifest 是 JSON，必须含 `schema_version`、`run_id`、`skill_name`、`status`、`created_at`、`inputs`、`outputs`、`validation`，且 `run_id`/`skill_name`/`status` 与实际一致；`status=success` 时还必须列齐本技能 required 产物（写进 `outputs`，path 指向真实存在的文件）。

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "run_id": "<runId>",
  "skill_name": "sure_feed",
  "status": "success",
  "created_at": "<ISO时间戳>",
  "inputs": { "args": "url=https://huggingface.co/OpenMOSS-Team/MOSS-Transcribe-Diarize" },
  "outputs": {
    "runtime_binding": { "type": "runtime_binding", "path": ".sure/runs/<runId>/artifacts/runtime_binding.json" },
    "model_input": { "type": "model_input", "path": ".sure/runs/<runId>/artifacts/model_input.yaml" },
    "feed_report": { "type": "feed_report", "path": ".sure/runs/<runId>/artifacts/feed_report.json" }
  },
  "validation": { "state_machine_complete": true }
}
```

本技能 required 产物：`runtime_binding`（`artifacts/runtime_binding.json`）、`model_input`（`artifacts/model_input.yaml`）、`feed_report`（`artifacts/feed_report.json`）。终态单元为 `emit_handoff_manifest`（`artifacts/debug/handoff_manifest.json`），对外交接产物是 `sure/handoffs/<model_name>/model_input.yaml`。
