# /sure_trans

Convert an existing model delivery into the same Eval-ready contract produced by `/sure_onboard`. Preserve the supplied source files, materialize a source image, add a generated adapter layer, validate original and adapted inference, push an immutable image, and seal `sure/models/<model_name>/`.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dockerfile` | conditional | Existing Dockerfile absolute path. Exactly one of `dockerfile` and `python_executable` is required. |
| `python_executable` | conditional | Existing local Python executable absolute path. Exactly one of `dockerfile` and `python_executable` is required. |
| `lockfile` | for Python | Reproducible dependency lockfile absolute path. |
| `package` / `package_profile` | no | `docker-registry` (default) or `none`. `none` requires Python input. |
| `model` | yes | Existing model file or directory absolute path. |
| `inference_entrypoint` | yes | Existing inference entrypoint absolute path. `inference_code` is an alias. |
| `framework` | yes | Computation framework. Must be `pytorch`; accept `torch` as an alias. |
| `model_framework` | yes | Model implementation framework. Prefer `transformers`; other safe identifiers such as `wenet`, `funasr`, or `custom` are allowed and require an architecture clarification. |
| `build_context` | no | Default to the Dockerfile parent directory. |
| `source_image_policy` | no | `auto` (default), `load`, or `build`. `auto` tries a tar below `build_context`, then falls back to Dockerfile build. |
| `image_tar` | no | Explicit image archive absolute path. It must be inside `build_context`. |
| `model_name` | yes | Must use `<organization>__<model-name>`; all bundle and image names use this value. |
| `task_type` | no | Infer from evidence; require an explicit value when ambiguous. |
| `fixture` | no | Absolute smoke input path. A same-stem `.expected.json` with a non-empty reference annotation is required; otherwise select an unambiguous `examples/smoke.*` file from the build context. |
| `device` | no | `auto` (default), `cuda`, or `cpu`. `cpu` validates with local Docker only; `cuda` and GPU-capable `auto` submit VC jobs to the dedicated partition `<vc_default_partition>`. |
| `model_mount_target` | no | Default to `/models/<model_name>`. |
| `model_stage_policy` | no | `auto` (default), `copy`, or `hardlink`; materialize the model payload into the final bundle. |
| `vc_partition` | no | VC partition for GPU validation; default and site requirement `<vc_default_partition>`. |
| `vc_memory_gb` | no | VC memory request in GiB; default 32. `<vc_default_partition>` caps each GPU at 32 GiB, so do not exceed it there. |
| `vc_gpus` | no | VC GPU count; default 1. |
| `image_version` | no | Explicit tag override for the site-resolved target repository. When omitted, query both resolved source and adapter repositories, find the highest `major.minor.patch` tag, and select the next unused patch version; an empty repository starts at `0.1.0`. |
| `max_retries` | no | Default 3. |

Example:

```text
/sure_trans dockerfile=/path/to/Dockerfile model=/path/to/model inference_entrypoint=/path/to/infer.py framework=pytorch model_framework=transformers model_name=organization__model task_type=asr
```

Python input example:

```text
/sure_trans python_executable=C:\path\.venv\Scripts\python.exe lockfile=C:\path\requirements.lock.txt model=C:\path\model inference_entrypoint=C:\path\infer.py framework=pytorch model_framework=transformers model_name=organization__model task_type=asr package=none
```

For Python input, dependency inspection, compatibility probing, original inference, and adapter validation run locally with the resolved `python_executable`. Every Python validation `run_command` must be an argument list whose first item is that exact executable. `package=none` finalization is handled by the later packaging path.

The Python adapter validation stages also run with that exact interpreter. After the adapter manifest is ready, materialize its local runtime evidence:

```bash
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/materialize_adapter_runtime.py --run-dir <run_dir>
```

For `import`, `load`, `infer`, and `contract`, use `[<python_executable>, <adapter>/validate.py, --stage, <stage>]` and one shared `SURE_VALIDATE_ARTIFACTS_DIR`. For MCP, run `mcp_smoke.py` with the same interpreter, record `protocol_path`, and pass `[<python_executable>, <adapter>/server.py]` as `--server-command`. The gate validates MCP protocol evidence on local Python as well as VC. This phase fingerprints the supplied runtime; the final `package=none` phase materializes and seals the uv runtime.

## Boundaries

- Treat `inference_entrypoint` as an entrypoint, not a complete dependency bundle.
- Treat the Docker build context, model path, declared support paths, and installed packages as the only allowed dependency roots.
- Do not scan filesystem roots or silently adopt same-named files from shared storage.
- Do not modify the supplied Dockerfile, model, or inference source in place.
- Keep model data outside the image, materialize it into `sure/models/<model_name>/`, and mount that approved bundle read-only.
- Treat MCP as the model invocation protocol. CPU validation runs in local Docker; GPU-touching validation submits VC jobs to `<vc_default_partition>`.
- Require the primary computation framework to be PyTorch. Auxiliary preprocessing may use native binaries or ONNX Runtime when recorded as a support dependency.
- Prefer Transformers as the model framework, but do not block a custom or other declared PyTorch model framework. Record the declaration, detected category, architecture signals, and clarification in `framework_detection.json`; rely on original inference, adapter inference, and equivalence gates for behavioral proof.

### Per-unit contract

Every unit's inputs, output fields and failure rules are described in the sections
below and in `schemas/`. One unit produces nothing a transformation needs and is
therefore spelled out here:

- **extract_lessons**: Inputs = `artifacts/run_digest.json`, written by the hook the moment `verdict` passed (read it; never rebuild it in place). Output = `extraction_declaration.json` {schema, no_new_lessons, no_lessons_reason, covered_by, candidates, infra_noise, infra_evidence} plus 0 to 5 candidate directories under `artifacts/candidates/<nn>-<slug>/` (`proposal.json` + `proposal.md`) and, for facts, evidence files under `artifacts/memory_evidence/`. The full contract (digest fields, candidate formats, the gate's ten checks, the write-tools-only rule) is `sure/runtime/memory/EXTRACTION.md`; read it before writing anything. Write candidates and evidence first and the declaration last. `no_new_lessons: true` with a one-line reason is the normal result of a clean run. Must Not Do: do not run `scripts/build_run_digest.py` onto `artifacts/run_digest.json` (a preview goes to `--out <run_dir>/artifacts/run_digest.preview.json` and the gate ignores it); do not write under `sure/memory/` or `references/memory/`; do not use bash heredocs for these files. Failure: `scripts/check_memory_extraction.py` says which check failed; after two consecutive failures the hook advances on its own with `extraction: failed`, and switching to `no_new_lessons: true` with the reason is always a valid way out.

## Deterministic Scripts

Run harness scripts from this skill directory with `HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN`.

Resolve the inputs first:

```bash
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/materialize_trans_inputs.py \
  --dockerfile <absolute-Dockerfile> \
  --model <absolute-model-path> \
  --inference-entrypoint <absolute-inference-file> \
  --framework pytorch \
  --model-framework transformers \
  --task-type <task> \
  --device <auto|cuda|cpu> \
  --vc-partition <partition> \
  --vc-memory-gb <gib> \
  --vc-gpus <count> \
  --run-dir <run_dir> \
  --repo-root <repo_root>
```

For Python input, replace `--dockerfile` with `--python-executable <absolute-python>` and `--lockfile <absolute-lockfile>`, and forward `--package <docker-registry|none>`.

Forward every user-provided optional parameter from the slash command into this invocation. Omitted `--vc-*` flags resolve to `<vc_default_partition>`, 32 GiB, and 1 GPU. Forward `--image-version` only when the user supplied it; otherwise input materialization reads the authenticated Registry V2 tag lists for both `<model_name>-source` and `<model_name>`, selects the next patch version, and records the repositories and observed tags in `trans_input_resolved.json.image_version_resolution`. Registry lookup failure blocks instead of guessing a possibly occupied tag.

Inspect the static dependency closure:

```bash
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/inspect_dependencies.py --run-dir <run_dir>
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/detect_framework.py --run-dir <run_dir>
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/prepare_fixture.py --run-dir <run_dir>
```

`detect_framework.py` blocks only when static evidence cannot establish PyTorch as the primary computation framework. A non-Transformers PyTorch model remains `status=ready`; the script writes `architecture_clarification` and any detected architecture signals, and the final verdict carries the same review information.

`prepare_fixture.py` copies both the selected audio and its same-stem `.expected.json`, writes `gt.jsonl` before the fixture gate runs, and records SHA256 for all three. Model predictions and equivalence baselines are never accepted as ground truth.

Materialize the source runtime with the resolved policy:

```bash
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/run_docker_build.py \
  --run-dir <run_dir> \
  --produces <run_dir>/artifacts/source_image_result.json
```

For Docker input, the source build automatically uses a generated Dockerfile layer that installs `git` and `ca-certificates` when `git` is absent. It supports apt, apk, dnf, yum, and microdnf; the supplied Dockerfile is never modified and its final `USER` is restored. A loaded source image tar receives the same derived layer before validation. For Python input, the same command records the resolved interpreter and lockfile identities without building an image.

With `source_image_policy=auto`, the runner recursively searches only below `build_context` for `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, or `.tgz` files. An explicit `image_tar` wins; otherwise candidates are ranked deterministically using in-context `delivery.json`, `SHA256SUMS`, and adjacent `image-inspect.json` evidence. Paths declared outside the current build context and symlinked archives are ignored.

The runner verifies any declared archive checksum, executes `docker load --input <tar>`, and confirms the loaded tag and live image ID with `docker image inspect`. If discovery, checksum, load, or inspection fails, `auto` executes `docker build --progress plain --file <Dockerfile> --tag <generated-tag> <build_context>`. `load` blocks instead of falling back; `build` skips archive discovery. Commands, logs, attempts, archive hash, Dockerfile hash, and the final live image identity are recorded in `source_image_result.json`.

Static analysis is evidence, not proof. Materialize the source runtime, create `execution_compat.json` with `status=pending`, and let the gate run `run_execution_compat.py`. It probes Python, Torch, Transformers, CUDA, and BF16 inside the Docker image or through the resolved local Python executable.

Execution surfaces split by device:

- `device=cpu`: the probe runs in local Docker without `--gpus`; `execution_surface=local_docker`.
- `device=cuda` or GPU-capable `auto`: the gate pushes the source image to `trans_input_resolved.json.container_delivery.source_image` and submits the probe through `vc submit` on `<vc_default_partition>`; `execution_surface=vc` with `vc_partition`, `vc_job_id`, `vc_memory_gb`, `vc_gpus`, and `vc_submit_command` recorded.
- `auto` with a model that does not require CUDA falls back to a local CPU probe only after the VC CUDA probe fails or times out; the fallback evidence is recorded in `fallback` and `execution_surface` stays `vc`. When `vc` is unavailable or the partition is not permitted, the gate blocks with a clear repair instead of silently falling back.

For original and adapter smoke units, write the stage artifact with a real `run_command`. The original inference and adapter inference artifacts also need `input`, the staged fixture the command consumes (`staged_path` from `fixture_manifest.json`), and the MCP artifact needs `tool_name`, the tool the adapter exposes. The gate executes the command through `run_trans_validate.py`, captures stdout/stderr and exit status, and only then writes the matching pass field. A manually written `status=passed` is not sufficient. A required field the artifact omits blocks the unit and spends a retry before the command ever runs, so write them all in one go.

The four adapter stages share one validation directory. `validate.py` reads `SURE_VALIDATE_ARTIFACTS_DIR` for everything it writes and reads, and the contract stage reads back the `sample_output.json` the infer stage wrote there. Mount **one** host directory for all of `import`, `load`, `infer`, `contract` and point the variable at it:

```bash
-v <run_dir>/artifacts/adapter_validation:/validation:rw -e SURE_VALIDATE_ARTIFACTS_DIR=/validation
```

Giving each stage its own directory makes the contract stage fail with `Missing sample output` every time, however well inference went, and each attempt spends a gate retry.

When the model is validated on GPU, `run_command` must be a `docker run ...` list (with `-v`/`-e`/`--entrypoint`/`-w` flags); the gate translates it into a VC job with the same mounts, environment, and command. `--mount` and unknown flags are rejected. On `device=cpu` a plain list or shell string also works.

When `--entrypoint` is omitted, the translation resolves the image ENTRYPOINT/CMD from the local Docker daemon via `docker image inspect` and applies the same docker semantics (entrypoint + positional args, or entrypoint + image CMD when no args are given). An explicit `--entrypoint` always wins. If the image is not present locally, the gate blocks with a repair telling the agent to add `--entrypoint` explicitly or load the image.

After original inference passes, materialize the model payload into the final model bundle:

```bash
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/stage_model_payload.py --run-dir <run_dir>
```

`auto` attempts hardlinks and falls back to copies. The final approved model directory must contain the actual payload because `/sure_infer` mounts only that directory; an external absolute model path is not an executable handoff.

Scaffold the adapter after original inference passes:

```bash
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/scaffold_adapter.py --run-dir <run_dir>
```

Replace the generated `adapter/model.py` scaffold with a model-specific wrapper. Prefer direct Python import and persistent model loading. Reject a per-sample subprocess that reloads the model unless no persistent integration exists and the user explicitly accepts the limitation.

## Adapter Contract

Implement:

```python
class ModelWrapper:
    def load(self) -> None: ...
    def predict(self, input_data): ...
    def healthcheck(self) -> dict: ...
```

Keep `server.py` protocol-only. Use stdin/stdout JSON-RPC, write logs to stderr, and expose the task tool declared in `config.yaml`. For ASR, expose `transcribe_audio` with `audio_path` and return a JSON-serializable object containing non-empty `text`.

The adapter image always bakes `/opt/sure_trans/mcp_smoke.py` (copied by `scaffold_adapter.py`). All MCP protocol verification runs that deterministic driver: it spawns `server.py`, drives `initialize` / `tools/list` / `tools/call` / `shutdown` over stdin with bounded deadlines, and writes `mcp_smoke.json` evidence. Never write ad-hoc MCP test scripts, and never start the server bare without driving requests — a bare server waits on stdin forever. The MCP stdout channel must stay a pure JSON-RPC stream: the generated `server.py` redirects model-library stdout to stderr during `tools/call`, and `mcp_smoke.py` skips stray non-JSON stdout lines while reading responses (recording them as `stdout_junk_*` evidence) — model loading progress prints must never corrupt the protocol.

Equivalence is decided by the gate, not by the command. Write `equivalence_result.json` with `baseline_output` and `adapter_output` as the **paths** of the two recorded output files (the original inference output and the adapter's `sample_output.json`), never the transcript text itself. The gate opens both, reads the adapter `io_contract` primary field out of each (falling back to the whole file when it is not JSON), compares them under `comparison_policy` (`normalized_whitespace` by default, or `exact`), and records what it read as `comparison_evidence`. An exit code alone never proves equivalence: a `/bin/true` command once carried this gate to passed while neither file was opened.

## Image Packaging

1. Materialize the source image with `run_docker_build.py`; default `auto` loads an in-context image tar first and falls back to a deterministic Dockerfile build.
2. Use `adapter/Dockerfile.sure` to layer `/opt/sure_trans/model.py`, `server.py`, `config.yaml`, `model.spec.yaml`, `__init__.py`, `validate.py`, and `mcp_smoke.py` onto the source image. The generated Dockerfile also copies the locked Harness Runtime into `/opt/sure-harness/<runtime_id>/`. If `SURE_HARNESS_RUNTIME_IMAGE` is set to a digest-pinned runtime image, build with `--build-context sure_harness_runtime=docker-image://<repository>@sha256:<digest>`; otherwise use `--build-context sure_harness_runtime=<SURE_HARNESS_RUNTIME_ROOT>`.
3. Mount the staged `sure/models/<model_name>/` bundle read-only at `model_mount_target` for load, infer, MCP, and pull-verification tests.
4. Validate import, persistent load, real inference, output contract, MCP initialize/list/call, and equivalence with original inference as separate gates.
5. Push the adapter image to `trans_input_resolved.json.container_delivery.target_image`, resolve `sha256:...`, pull the exact `repository@sha256:...` reference, and repeat the MCP smoke test. Registry transport and authentication are deployment concerns; use the Docker daemon configuration for the active site. When the model was validated on GPU, the post-pull MCP smoke must itself run on VC through `mcp_smoke.py`; submit the **tag** with `--expect-digest` (see the VC section below — `vc submit` rejects digest-pinned references) and record its `vc_job_id`, `vc_partition=<vc_default_partition>`, `exit_code=0`, `image_ref`, the `resolved_digest` the submission proved, and the log path as `post_pull_smoke` in `docker_registry_result.json`, keeping `mcp_smoke.json` evidence next to that log path (the registry gate checks `resolved_digest` against `target_image_digest` and the initialize/tools/list/tools/call evidence).

The source image is pushed before unit 6 and the adapter image before unit 11 by the gate scripts; both record `registry_ref` and `registry_push` evidence into `source_image_result.json` and `adapter_image_result.json` respectively. The unit 17 post-pull smoke reuses the same registry name without repushing. These image and registry steps apply only to `package=docker-registry`.

For Python input with `package=none`, unit 17 instead runs:

```bash
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/package_python_runtime.py --run-dir <run_dir>
```

This uses the active site policy's Model Runtime root, materializes a content-addressed uv environment from the supplied Python and hash-locked requirements file, and writes a portable runtime manifest into the bundle. Relative local distributions referenced by the lock, including wheels, are content-addressed and copied below `artifacts/local-distributions/`; the rewritten portable lock and artifact manifest cover them. The virtual environment itself remains site-local because it is OS, architecture, Python ABI, and dependency specific. No Docker daemon or registry is involved. The legacy artifact filename `docker_registry_result.json` is retained only to avoid changing the state-machine artifact slot; its schema is `sure.trans.python_package_result.v1` for this profile.

Naming, image boundary, tag increment, and push-failure recovery conventions live in `references/image_packaging.md`; on conflict, this section and the gates win.

Automatic selection is advisory until the immutable push succeeds: another run can claim the selected tag after input resolution. The registry's no-overwrite policy remains the final concurrency guard. On that race, rerun input materialization to select the next free version, or pass an explicit unused `image_version`; never overwrite the existing tag.

## VC Execution

`<vc_default_partition>`, `execution.vc_project`, and the source/target image repositories are site policy values, not constants. Repositories are resolved from `network.container_registry` plus `container_delivery.repository_template` in `config/site.bundled.yaml` (or `config/site.local.yaml`) and persisted in `trans_input_resolved.json`. Read policy with `npm run sure:site-info`; never hardcode a site value in this skill.

GPU-touching work never runs `docker run --gpus all` on the login node. Gates submit to `<vc_default_partition>` through `scripts/vc_exec.py`; the same CLI drives the unit 17 post-pull MCP smoke:

```bash
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/vc_exec.py \
  --image <target_repository>:<version> \
  --expect-digest sha256:<digest> \
  --command "python /opt/sure_trans/mcp_smoke.py --audio /fixture/smoke.wav --tool <tool_name> --produces <run_dir>/artifacts/vc_logs/post_pull_smoke/mcp_smoke.json" \
  --mount <bundle_dir>:/models/<model_name>:ro \
  --mount <run_dir>/fixture:/fixture:ro \
  --partition <vc_default_partition> \
  --gpus 1 --memory-gb 48 --cpus 8 \
  --log-dir <run_dir>/artifacts/vc_logs/post_pull_smoke \
  --produces <run_dir>/artifacts/vc_logs/post_pull_smoke.json
```

- `vc submit` takes `repo:tag` only: it answers `镜像不存在` to every `repo@sha256:...` reference, however well that digest pulls with docker. Submit the tag and pass `--expect-digest`; `vc_exec.py` pulls the tag, reads back the manifest digest the registry serves for it, and refuses to submit when it is not the pinned one. It records `image_ref` and `resolved_digest`, which is what the registry gate checks against `target_image_digest`. Copy both into `docker_registry_result.json` under `post_pull_smoke`. Never hand a digest-pinned reference to `vc submit`, and never write `resolved_digest` by hand.
- Defaults: 1 GPU, 32 GiB, 8 CPUs, 1800 s poll timeout. `vc_memory_gb` and `vc_gpus` from the slash command override the memory/GPU defaults; the partition defaults to `<vc_default_partition>`.
- Every submitted job wraps its container command in `timeout --kill-after=15 <seconds>` (default 1200 s, `--command-timeout-seconds` on the CLI). A hung command is killed and still writes `exit_code` (124), so the submit host never waits for a file that will never appear; exit 124 surfaces a targeted repair.
- Never submit a raw `vc submit` and then hand-roll `sleep`/`while` polling loops in bash. Re-running a job always goes through `scripts/vc_exec.py`, which polls the `exit_code` file internally and records `vc info --job` / `vc logs` diagnostics.
- Mount preparation is deterministic: the gate creates missing bind-mount host sources as the submitting user before `vc submit` (the vc platform would otherwise create them as `nobody`, which the job uid cannot write); a missing `:ro` source blocks, and an existing unwritable directory blocks with a repair telling the agent to recreate the empty scratch dir or point the mount at a user-owned path. Job-side `Permission denied` on an output mount surfaces the same repair.
- `vc submit` requires the quota project; the gates pass the `execution.vc_project` value from site policy automatically (override with `--project` on the CLI).
- Job evidence lands under `artifacts/vc_logs/<stage>/`: `inner.sh`, `stdout.log`, `stderr.log`, `exit_code`, `vc_job.log`. Push logs live at `artifacts/vc_logs/source_push.log` and `adapter_push.log`.
- The submit host polls the `exit_code` file written by the in-job wrapper; `vc info --job` and `vc logs` output is diagnostic evidence only.
- Never submit real VC jobs outside this skill's gates or a `/sure_trans` run the user started.

Memory sizing is enforced deterministically:

- `<vc_default_partition>` caps 32 GiB RAM per GPU. Before submitting a model-loading
  validation (original inference, load, infer, contract, MCP, equivalence), the
  gate compares the payload size with 2x loading headroom against
  `vc_memory_gb` and blocks with the exact fix (`vc_gpus=2 vc_memory_gb=64`).
- When a job fails with exit 137 / `OOMKilled` / `std::bad_alloc` / `Killed`,
  the gate repairs with the RAM sizing fix. A `CUDA out of memory` failure is
  confirmed from a non-zero exit code plus the OOM evidence, in the job log or
  in the stage result file the container wrote, and is then resubmitted up to
  eight times on the selected VC partition so the scheduler can place it on
  another available GPU allocation. A job that logs a recovered OOM and still
  exits 0 is a pass, not a retry. Retries also stop once the hook's gate budget
  no longer fits another attempt, which `gpu_oom_retry_budget_exhausted`
  records. The first attempt logs in `artifacts/vc_logs/<stage>/` and each
  resubmission gets its own `artifacts/vc_logs/<stage>/oom-attempt-N/`.
  The VC interface does not expose a physical GPU selector, so this is bounded
  rescheduling, not a guarantee of eight distinct cards. After the eighth CUDA
  OOM, the gate reports the existing VRAM guidance (reduce batch/beam, enable
  bf16, or shard the model).

## Eval Handoff

Generate `runtime_inventory.json` with schema `sure.onboard.runtime_inventory.v2`:

```bash
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/write_runtime_inventory.py --run-dir <run_dir> --python-executable <container-python> --tool-name <tool>
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/write_verdict.py --run-dir <run_dir>
```

For `package=docker-registry`, verify:

- `status=ready`
- `policy.eval_runtime=container_only`
- `policy.host_python_fallback=false`
- `policy.image_override_allowed=false`
- `container_runtime.target_image_ref` to a digest-pinned image

For `package=none`, omit `--python-executable`: the writer reads the sealed Model Runtime manifest and emits `policy.eval_runtime=python`, `container_runtime.required=false`, a relative runtime executable (`bin/python` on POSIX or `Scripts/python.exe` on Windows), and `host_python_fallback=false`.
- `container_runtime.server_command` to the adapter MCP server
- `container_runtime.mount_policy.nfs_models_read_only=true`

Write a successful `verdict.json`, then run:

```bash
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/finalize_trans_bundle.py --run-dir <run_dir>
```

This seals the already-staged model payload, adapter, and small evidence under `sure/models/<model_name>/`. Docker delivery produces the existing `sure.onboard.deployment_ready.v1` bundle with `Dockerfile.sure` and digest-pinned image evidence. Python `package=none` produces `sure.onboard.deployment_ready.v2` with `requirements.lock`, `artifacts/model_runtime_manifest.json`, and a Python Model Runtime binding compatible with `/sure_eval`. Both profiles include `fixture/<task>/`, terminal sidecars, `integrity_profile=manifest-complete-v1`, and `weights_integrity=bundled`; hashes cover every required wrapper, fixture, evidence file, generated sample output, and staged payload file.

The generated `validate.py` keeps the same CLI contract as `/sure_onboard`: `--stage import|load|infer|contract|all`, writing `<stage>_result.json` and, during infer, `sample_output.json` into `SURE_VALIDATE_ARTIFACTS_DIR`, then validating that sample against the filled `io_contract` in the contract stage — from the same directory. For `tts` and `vc`, the generated audio that `sample_output.audio_path` points at must be written below `$SURE_VALIDATE_ARTIFACTS_DIR/outputs`, because finalization only promotes generated audio from there into the bundle. The adapter image embeds the locked Harness Runtime; `runtime_inventory.harness_runtime.required=true`, so `/sure_infer` uses the image binding and does not mount the repository Harness Runtime into the model container.

After completion, run inference locally without changing the model protocol:

```text
/sure_infer model=<model_name> execution=local
```

## Stopping Without a Bundle

When one of the Failure Rules fires, the run stops where it is; it does not
finish successfully and it does not write a readiness marker by hand. Seal the
run as blocked instead, from wherever it stopped:

```bash
"$HARNESS_PYTHON_BIN" scripts/finalize_trans_bundle.py --run-dir <run_dir> \
  --blocked "<what stopped the run>"
```

That writes `artifacts/deployment_ready.json` with `status=blocked`, the reason,
hashes of whatever terminal evidence exists, and
`execution_policy.container_only=false`. Nothing is staged into
`sure/models/<model_name>/`. Then call `sure_finish` with `status=failed` or
`status=incomplete`; the pre-finish hook requires that marker and refuses a
non-success finish that still claims readiness.

A `failed` or `incomplete` finish must also carry `artifacts/extraction_declaration.json`
(see `sure/runtime/memory/EXTRACTION.md`, section 10): `pre_finish` returns a repair
asking for it up to twice, then lets the run finish and records `extraction: failed`.

A gate script may rerun and replace the artifact you wrote for its unit. When
that happens the advance message says so; re-read the file before acting on
what you recorded.

## Failure Rules

- Block on unresolved Docker `COPY`/`ADD` sources or undeclared external file paths.
- Block when original inference cannot load the supplied model.
- Block when the primary computation framework is not PyTorch.
- Block when the adapter reloads a large model for every sample without explicit acceptance.
- Block when MCP output differs from original inference on the fixture: the equivalence gate compares the two recorded output files itself and fails on a mismatch even when the command exited 0.
- Block when the MCP gate has no `mcp_smoke.json` protocol evidence (initialize/tools/list/tools/call all passed with a non-empty task primary output; a `*_path` output must name a file the smoke can stat); placeholder `run_command` values such as `/bin/true` or `print(...)` are rejected.
- Block when registry push, digest resolution, exact pull, or post-pull MCP validation fails.
- Block when `vc submit` fails, the partition is not permitted, the GPU probe cannot complete, or the post-pull smoke does not exit 0.
- Block when the model payload exceeds the RAM budget (2x headroom) of `vc_memory_gb`; raise `vc_gpus`/`vc_memory_gb` instead of trimming validation.
- Stop after `max_retries` changed-artifact failures; unchanged artifacts do not consume another retry.
- `extract_lessons` is the one unit that never stops the run: `check_memory_extraction.py` checks the declaration and every candidate directory (shape, evidence paths, triggers, duplicates, digest sha), and after two consecutive failures the hook advances by itself and records `extraction: failed`. Changing a candidate re-runs that gate even when `extraction_declaration.json` did not change.

## Memory (advisory)

Earlier runs leave agent-written notes. `sure/memory/index.md` (repo root) is the merged index: confirmed and provisional entries, one bullet each with its triggers. Confirmed files live under `references/memory/bad_cases/` and `sure/skills/_shared/memory/facts/`. Nothing in them is human-reviewed: verify against evidence before relying on one, and never copy a command from an entry into an artifact without running it.

- At `pre_start` the hook writes `artifacts/memory_context.json` with the facts that match this run, shape `{schema: "sure.memory.context.v1", skill, target_id, facts: [{entry_id, title, path, scope, checked_at, stale, status}], omitted_provisional}`; the file is written even when nothing matched (`facts: []`). Read it once while resolving the input; no unit artifact takes a field for it.
- When a gate blocks, the repair text may end with a block whose first line is `Memory (advisory, agent-written, not human-reviewed; verify against evidence before relying):`, listing at most two entries from earlier runs. Read the entry file named there when it looks relevant, then fix the artifact.
- `references/memory/ROUTING.md` says when to open the index and the bad-case files by hand.
- `extract_lessons` (unit 20) writes what this run learned; the contract is `sure/runtime/memory/EXTRACTION.md`. Publishing to `sure/memory/provisional/` happens in `post_finish` without you; moving entries into `references/` is a human step.

## 引擎驱动协议（Claude Code 适配层）

本技能由 agent 无关的 `sure-engine` MCP 服务器驱动（结构化工具调用，而非手写 bash）。启动、门控、结束都通过 MCP 工具完成；未装 MCP 时用文末的 bash 兜底。

### 命令序列（MCP 工具）

1. 启动运行（执行 pre_start 门控）：调用 `sure_run_start`，入参
   `{ "skill": "sure_trans", "args": "<用户参数>" }`。若用户以 `/sure_trans <参数>` 带入参数就用它；否则用手册 args 示例（如 `dockerfile=/path/to/Dockerfile model=/path/to/model inference_entrypoint=/path/to/infer.py framework=pytorch model_framework=transformers model_name=org__model task_type=asr`）补齐，或先向用户索取必需参数。
   成功返回 `{ ok:true, runId, prompt, record, state }`，**记下 runId**；失败返回 `{ ok:false, repair }`，按 repair 修正后重试。

2. 每次 Bash 操作**前**：调用 `sure_run_gate`，入参
   `{ "runId": "<runId>", "point": "pre_tool_call", "tool": "bash", "command": "<实际命令>" }`。
   返回 `allowed:false` 时**不得执行**该命令，按 `repair` 修正后重新门控。

3. 执行 shell 命令。

4. 每次 Bash 操作**后**：调用 `sure_run_gate`，入参
   `{ "runId": "<runId>", "point": "post_tool_result", "tool": "bash", "isError": <true|false> }`。
   这是状态机推进点；`allowed:false` 表示当前单元产物未通过门控，按 `repair` 修产物后再次 post 门控，不跳单元。

5. 重复 2–4，直到状态机到达终态单元。

6. 结束运行：先写最终 manifest（见下），再调用 `sure_run_finish`，入参
   `{ "runId": "<runId>", "status": "success", "manifestPath": ".sure/runs/<runId>/manifest.json", "summary": "<摘要>" }`。
   manifest 校验或 pre_finish 门控失败返回 `{ ok:false, repair }`，按 repair 修 manifest/产物后再 finish。

其它工具：`sure_run_state`（查状态，`{runId}`）、`sure_run_resume`（续接，`{runId}` 可省）、`sure_run_on_error`（出错收尾，`{runId, reason}`）。

### 门控纪律（必须）

- run 启动后，**每次** Bash 操作都必须先 `sure_run_gate`（pre_tool_call）、后 `sure_run_gate`（post_tool_result），不许跳过。
- pre 门控 `allowed:false`：不执行该命令，先修。
- post 门控 `allowed:false`：当前单元未通过，先修产物，不跳单元、不盲跑。
- 状态机只在 post 门控通过时推进；不要手动改 `.sure/runs/<runId>/state.json` 或 checkpoint。
- 若安装了 `install.sh --with-hooks` 硬拦截，中间门控由 Claude hooks 自动执行，agent 只需 start/finish。

### 无 MCP 时 bash 兜底

`node <repo>/sure-engine/dist/cli.js run start|gate|finish|state|resume|on-error ...`，与上述 MCP 工具一一对应（参数与工具入参一致，`--cwd <repo>` 指向含 `sure/skills/` 的目录）。

### 最终 manifest

最终 manifest 是 JSON，必须含 `schema_version`、`run_id`、`skill_name`、`status`、`created_at`、`inputs`、`outputs`、`validation`，且 `run_id`/`skill_name`/`status` 与实际一致；`status=success` 时还必须列齐本技能 required 产物（写进 `outputs`，path 指向真实存在的文件）。

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "run_id": "<runId>",
  "skill_name": "sure_trans",
  "status": "success",
  "created_at": "<ISO时间戳>",
  "inputs": { "args": "dockerfile=/path/to/Dockerfile model=/path/to/model inference_entrypoint=/path/to/infer.py framework=pytorch model_framework=transformers model_name=org__model task_type=asr" },
  "outputs": {
    "dependency_report": { "type": "dependency_report", "path": ".sure/runs/<runId>/artifacts/inference_dependency_report.json" },
    "framework_detection": { "type": "framework_detection", "path": ".sure/runs/<runId>/artifacts/framework_detection.json" },
    "fixture": { "type": "fixture", "path": ".sure/runs/<runId>/artifacts/fixture_manifest.json" },
    "execution_compat": { "type": "execution_compat", "path": ".sure/runs/<runId>/artifacts/execution_compat.json" },
    "source_runtime": { "type": "source_runtime", "path": ".sure/runs/<runId>/artifacts/source_image_result.json" },
    "model_payload": { "type": "model_payload", "path": ".sure/runs/<runId>/artifacts/model_payload_manifest.json" },
    "runtime_inventory": { "type": "runtime_inventory", "path": ".sure/runs/<runId>/artifacts/runtime_inventory.json" },
    "verdict": { "type": "verdict", "path": ".sure/runs/<runId>/artifacts/verdict.json" },
    "deployment_ready": { "type": "deployment_ready", "path": ".sure/runs/<runId>/artifacts/deployment_ready.json" }
  },
  "validation": { "state_machine_complete": true }
}
```

本技能 required 产物：`dependency_report`（`artifacts/inference_dependency_report.json`）、`framework_detection`（`artifacts/framework_detection.json`）、`fixture`（`artifacts/fixture_manifest.json`）、`execution_compat`（`artifacts/execution_compat.json`）、`source_runtime`（`artifacts/source_image_result.json`）、`model_payload`（`artifacts/model_payload_manifest.json`）、`runtime_inventory`（`artifacts/runtime_inventory.json`）、`verdict`（`artifacts/verdict.json`）、`deployment_ready`（`artifacts/deployment_ready.json`）。终态单元为 `finalize_model_bundle`（`artifacts/deployment_ready.json`）。
